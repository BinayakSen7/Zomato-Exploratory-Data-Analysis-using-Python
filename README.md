# Zomato Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Zomato restaurant dataset to extract meaningful insights about restaurants, cuisines, ratings, pricing, and customer preferences. The analysis helps understand food industry trends and supports data-driven decision-making.

The complete analysis is implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.
